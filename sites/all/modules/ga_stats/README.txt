# Google Analytics Statistics

Provides views integration for the Google Analytics Data Export API by caching
the data to the Drupal database.

This allows you to use Google Analytics directly through views to do things
like Most Popular, Most Read etc. You can combine the statistics to create
interesting results.

After you install the module - go to /admin/config/services/ga_stats to
configure your Google Analytics account information and begin pulling
statistics.
