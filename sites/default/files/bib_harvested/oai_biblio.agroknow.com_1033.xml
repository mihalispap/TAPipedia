  <dc:description>&lt;p&gt;The book offers insights into the theory and practice of ‘innovation systems’. It covers background and concepts about the ‘how to’ of facilitating innovation, and the role of the broader context. The emphasis is about the dynamics of rural innovation – how to work with the changing nature of both the context and people involved in rural innovation processes and how to facilitate networks of stakeholders to stimulate innovation. It offers support to agricultural and rural development professionals as enablers and facilitators of stakeholder-led innovation, based on evidence from inspirational stories of how different people – from farmers to extension of officers, business leaders, traders, NGO staff, and policy makers – collaborate to make new and successful things happen.&lt;/p&gt;</dc:description>
