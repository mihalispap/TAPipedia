  <dc:description>&lt;p&gt;Reports on a 2007 World Bank workshop aimed to take stock of recent experiences with innovation systems and reconsider strategies for the future development of agricultural innovation systems. Specifically, sought to (i) take stock of and gain a better understanding of the agricultural innovation systems approach, (ii) identify how the agricultural innovation systems approach contributes to growth, development, and poverty reduction, (iii) identify how the agricultural innovation systems approach has been and can be further operationalized, and (iv) explore the desirability of forming a community of practice. The paper summarizes recommendations for those responsible of puting the AIS perspective to work under different specific country situation&lt;/p&gt;</dc:description>
