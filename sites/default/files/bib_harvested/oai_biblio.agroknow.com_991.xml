  <dc:description>&lt;p&gt;The paper discusses the work force development (Wfd) tool that places explicit focus on three functional dimensions of WfD policies and institutions: (a) strategy; (b) system oversight; and (c) service delivery. Strategy refers to the alignment between workforce development and a country’s national goals for economic and social development. System oversight refers to the governance arrangements that shape the behaviors key stakeholders involved, including individuals, employers, and training providers. Service delivery refers to arrangements for managing the provision of services in order to achieve results on the ground. The tool’s pilot testing in five countries–Chile, South Korea, Ireland, Singapore, and Uganda—suggest that the three broad functional dimensions are indeed the right ones to focus on in workforce development.The paper discusses the work force development (Wfd) tool that places explicit focus on three functional dimensions of WfD policies and institutions: (a) strategy; (b) system oversight; and (c) service delivery.
