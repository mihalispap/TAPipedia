  <dc:description>&lt;p&gt;Six key themes that emerged from the European Union (EU) funded LEARNing project designed to develop and test a systemic approach to research practice are reported. The focus was on the learning and knowing processes experienced by individuals, groups and institutions that emerges from collective action and results in changes in practices or in the potential to change practices of those involved. The authors, drawn by the idea that the key to understanding knowledge is to be found in “how we know what we know”, or, in other words, in the processes of “learning and knowing” present these themes: processes, theory, evaluation, institutionalisation and social and professional practice as a basis for further innovation in the conduct of R&amp;amp;D and as a basis for future capability building of researchers.&lt;/p&gt;</dc:description>
