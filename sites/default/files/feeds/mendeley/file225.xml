         <dcterms:abstract>Landscapes are complex systems that show many different patterns according to the scale of resolution and the component towards which the investigation is directed. Two main patterns are described in this chapter, the heterogeneity and the ecotones. Both are produced by different processes of which disturbance and fragmentation, in particular, are very influential. Heterogeneity is the main pattern of every landscape and strictly linked with this pattern we find the edges or ecotones. Every pattern produced by processes is in turn a producer of new processes. In particular, heterogeneity has a dramatic influence on many processes across the landscape. Ecotones are special areas in which different types of habitats meet and where ecological processes are strongly influenced by the co-occurrences of different land attributes. Their role is fundamental to understanding landscape complexity and its functioning.</dcterms:abstract>
